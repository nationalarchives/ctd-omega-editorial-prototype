text: "They were pleased when the registration district was formed to find themselves in the same district as the parishes of Audley, Betley, Keel [Keele], Great Madeley, Burslem and Wolstanton and this led them to expect that this would eventually form a union under the Poor Law Act. This would be highly satisfactory as Newcastle under Lyme was the only post town in the district and had a grant for a Court of Quarter Sessions for the Borough, which would be convenient for transacting the business of a union. While the parish of Stoke upon Trent was trying to effect a union with Newcastle under Lyme, and representing Newcastle under Lyme as being in support of their proposal, this was assuredly not the case. The basis of the petition was that should such a union be formed, Newcastle under Lyme would have no chance of fair representation in the board of guardians because of the much greater population of Stoke upon Trent: they calculated that it would be a ratio of four to one against Newcastle under Lyme. They requested to be part of a union with Audley, Betley, Keel [Keele], Great Madeley, Burslem and Wolstanton, or similarly-sized parishes. It was signed by: Thomas Ward, Mayor; Robert Hall, Justice; John Mason, Justice; Thomas Phillips; John Nickisson; Elias Shaw.
